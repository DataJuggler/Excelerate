    <Description>Excelerate uses EPPPlus version 4.5.3.3 (last free version), and it makes it easy to load Workbooks or Worksheets. Excelerate now has a code generation feature, you can create a C# class from a header row.

I have a couple of clients that I build programs that automate combining columns from multiple Worksheets to form reports.

Rather than continue to write custom loaders, I really only need custom Exporters in most cases, so I created this project.</Description>

    <PackageReleaseNotes>11.2.2021 (Take Two)
Version 1.3.1: The previous version code generated the Save method incorrectly. This should fix it.

11.2.2021
Version 1.3.0: I now code generate a Save method, so the current Row.Column's ColumnValues are updated with the current value of this object.

11.1.2021
Version 1.2.8: I updated Worksheet.Columns is now set to first row.Columns when the Worksheet is loaded.
I added a NewRow method, that returns a new row with the columns set.
I updated AttemptToDetermineDataType to set ZipCode and PostalCode fields to a string, not an integer.

Code Generating a Save method is next I think.

10.31.2021 (Take Eight)
This time, DataJuggler.UlimateHelper was updated. The ParseBoolean method got an upgrade.

10.31.2021 (Take Seven)
Version 1.2.6: I updated ParseBoolean to use DataJuggler.UltimateHelper.BooleanHelper.ParseBoolean. We will see if this converts a 1 to a true and a zero to a false. I think it does after 11 years.

10.31.2021: (Take Six)
Version 1.2.5: I fixed Active being a boolean, and discovered the LoadMethod was trying to set bool columns to a string value.

10.31.2021: (Take Five)
Version 1.2.4: I fixed the Active field = boolean. I need an else so the data type didn't get set to Int further in the AttemptToDetermineDataType method.

10.31.2021: (Take Four)
Version 1.2.3: Added a check for data type boolean. To make this work, convert Excel bool values to True False vs 0 and 1.

10.31.2021 (Take Three)
Version 1.2.2: Code generation is fixed with a reference to System is needed since Guid RowId has been added.

10.31.2021 (Take Two)
Version 1.2.1: I messed up the code generation in Version 1.2.0 because the RowId field wasn't getting a field name written. Should work now.

10.31.2021: 
Version 1.2.0: The code generation of the RowId seems to work, so the 1.2 version starts the Saving features.

10.31.2021
Version 1.1.10: I added RowNumber and Id (Guid) to class Row to help in saving, which I am just starting.

10.16.2021
Version 1.1.9: I added a new method LoadAllData, which returns a DataJuggler.Excelerate.Workbook, which contains all DataJuggler.Excelerate.Worksheets, which contain all DataJuggler.Excelerate.Rows of data.

10.16.2021:
Version 1.1.8: AppendPartialGuid is now an optional parameter, and only if true will the partial guid be appended to the filename.


10.14.2021: 
Version 1.1.7: CodeGenerator.GenerateClassFromWorksheet now returns an object of type CodeGenerationResponse. Previous version only returns a boolean, which wasn't very helpful for the caller.

10.13.2021: New override for GetSheetNames takes a path argument.
I am working on a new Blazor project called Blazor.Excelerate to demo this project.

9.21.2021
Version 1.1.5:
I created an ExcelHelper class because I needed the GetColumnLetter feature of ExcelCellAddress.

9.20.2021
Version 1.1.4:
I updated ExcelDataLoader to havea  LoadPackage method.

9.20.2021:
Version 1.1.3:
I added an OriginalFileName property to class Column, so the exported column header can be the same as the original.

9.17.2021
Version 1.1.2:
The Code Generator class is now finished, and a Load method has been updated to test for
a null row or null row.Columns just to be safer.

More updates may come in the future, but for now I have completed what I started this project for.
For the amount of effort I put into this, I think the return on investment is quite satisfactory as
now I can build Excel projects much faster. 

9.17.2021
Version 1.1.1: I now code generate a Load method with the Code Generator, so a Row can be used to load an instance of the class created. This is still being tested.

9.15.2021
Version 1.0.3: I added a LoadWorksheet override, so clients do not have to load a Workbook to get
to a single worksheet.

This is the first release. I have just begun adding classes and helper methods to this. It does work for now to load a worksheet and all the Rows / Columns. Each column is loaded as an object ColumnValue, than properties exist that cast the ColumnValue as a bool, datetime, Decimal or other types.</PackageReleaseNotes>
