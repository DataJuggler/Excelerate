    <Description>Excelerate uses EPPPlus version 4.5.3.3 (last free version), and it makes it easy to load Workbooks or Worksheets. Excelerate now has a code generation feature, you can create a C# class from a header row.

I have a couple of clients that I build programs that automate combining columns from multiple Worksheets to form reports.

Rather than continue to write custom loaders, I really only need custom Exporters in most cases, so I created this project.</Description>

    <PackageReleaseNotes>11.8.2021 (Take Four)
Version 1.4.2: My code generated NewRowMethod, used row.Columns.Add(column) instead of newRow.Columns.Add(column). I fixed this to use the variable name newRow.

11.8.2021 (Take Three)
Version 1.4.1: I realized I had to add a using statement reference for DataJuggler.Net5
to the code generated classes.

11.8.2021 (Take Two)
Version 1.4.0: The Add New Method code generation appears to work. 
I am updating Blazor Excelerate with this version and will continue to test.

11.8.2021
Version 1.3.14: First attempt at code generating the NewRow method.

11.7.2021 (Take Two)
Version 1.3.12: I added two new features:
1. ColumnValue for a boolean column, can now be exported as 0 or 1 (instead of True / False).
To use this, set ExportBooleanAsOneOrZero to true, and the DataType must be a DataManager.DataTypes.Boolean
2. I added a FindColumn method to the row object, to make setting ExportBooleanAsOneOrZero easier.

11.7.2021
Version 1.3.10: BooleanHelper, part of DataJuggler.UltimateHelper had a bug in the ParseBoolean method.

11.6.2021 (Take Four)
Version 1.3.9: I set StringValue to an empty string if an error occurrs.

11.6.2021 (Take Three)
Version 1.3.8: Before 1.3.7 Nuget package email arrived that it was ready, I realized I needed to
create the WorksheetInfo object in the constructor also.

11.6.2021 (Take Two)
Version 1.3.7: While working on Excelerate.WinForms.Deo, I realized I needed to create the Updates collection
and I decided it saved two lines of code in my demo to do this in the constructor.

11.6.2021
Version 1.3.6: I created two new methods SaveBatch and SaveBatchItem.

SaveBatch represents saving data from multple worksheets
SaveBatchItem represents saving data from one worksheet.

Both of these methods are untested, so at this time use with caution.

11.4.2021 (Take Four)
Version 1.3.5: I had forgotten to add saved = true to ExcelHelper.Save method at the end of the Save method.

11.4.2021 (Take Three)
Version 1.3.4: I discovered too late the ExcelHelper.Save method is not static. 

11.4.2021 (Take Two)
Version 1.3.3: My previous Save method had the return value in the wrong place.

Hopefully this fixes it. I am too lazy to add the project and propertly debug it.

11.4.2021
Version 1.3.2: While working on Save I realized I needed to return the row from the code generated Save method
so Excel can be updated. Save is still being tested, so use with caution.

11.2.2021 (Take Two)
Version 1.3.1: The previous version code generated the Save method incorrectly. This should fix it.

11.2.2021
Version 1.3.0: I now code generate a Save method, so the current Row.Column's ColumnValues are updated with the current value of this object.

11.1.2021
Version 1.2.8: I updated Worksheet.Columns is now set to first row.Columns when the Worksheet is loaded.
I added a NewRow method, that returns a new row with the columns set.
I updated AttemptToDetermineDataType to set ZipCode and PostalCode fields to a string, not an integer.

Code Generating a Save method is next I think.

10.31.2021 (Take Eight)
This time, DataJuggler.UlimateHelper was updated. The ParseBoolean method got an upgrade.

10.31.2021 (Take Seven)
Version 1.2.6: I updated ParseBoolean to use DataJuggler.UltimateHelper.BooleanHelper.ParseBoolean. We will see if this converts a 1 to a true and a zero to a false. I think it does after 11 years.

10.31.2021: (Take Six)
Version 1.2.5: I fixed Active being a boolean, and discovered the LoadMethod was trying to set bool columns to a string value.

10.31.2021: (Take Five)
Version 1.2.4: I fixed the Active field = boolean. I need an else so the data type didn't get set to Int further in the AttemptToDetermineDataType method.

10.31.2021: (Take Four)
Version 1.2.3: Added a check for data type boolean. To make this work, convert Excel bool values to True False vs 0 and 1.

10.31.2021 (Take Three)
Version 1.2.2: Code generation is fixed with a reference to System is needed since Guid RowId has been added.

10.31.2021 (Take Two)
Version 1.2.1: I messed up the code generation in Version 1.2.0 because the RowId field wasn't getting a field name written. Should work now.

10.31.2021: 
Version 1.2.0: The code generation of the RowId seems to work, so the 1.2 version starts the Saving features.

10.31.2021
Version 1.1.10: I added RowNumber and Id (Guid) to class Row to help in saving, which I am just starting.

10.16.2021
Version 1.1.9: I added a new method LoadAllData, which returns a DataJuggler.Excelerate.Workbook, which contains all DataJuggler.Excelerate.Worksheets, which contain all DataJuggler.Excelerate.Rows of data.

10.16.2021:
Version 1.1.8: AppendPartialGuid is now an optional parameter, and only if true will the partial guid be appended to the filename.


10.14.2021: 
Version 1.1.7: CodeGenerator.GenerateClassFromWorksheet now returns an object of type CodeGenerationResponse. Previous version only returns a boolean, which wasn't very helpful for the caller.

10.13.2021: New override for GetSheetNames takes a path argument.
I am working on a new Blazor project called Blazor.Excelerate to demo this project.

9.21.2021
Version 1.1.5:
I created an ExcelHelper class because I needed the GetColumnLetter feature of ExcelCellAddress.

9.20.2021
Version 1.1.4:
I updated ExcelDataLoader to havea  LoadPackage method.

9.20.2021:
Version 1.1.3:
I added an OriginalFileName property to class Column, so the exported column header can be the same as the original.

9.17.2021
Version 1.1.2:
The Code Generator class is now finished, and a Load method has been updated to test for
a null row or null row.Columns just to be safer.

More updates may come in the future, but for now I have completed what I started this project for.
For the amount of effort I put into this, I think the return on investment is quite satisfactory as
now I can build Excel projects much faster. 

9.17.2021
Version 1.1.1: I now code generate a Load method with the Code Generator, so a Row can be used to load an instance of the class created. This is still being tested.

9.15.2021
Version 1.0.3: I added a LoadWorksheet override, so clients do not have to load a Workbook to get
to a single worksheet.

This is the first release. I have just begun adding classes and helper methods to this. It does work for now to load a worksheet and all the Rows / Columns. Each column is loaded as an object ColumnValue, than properties exist that cast the ColumnValue as a bool, datetime, Decimal or other types.</PackageReleaseNotes>
